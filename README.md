# **Inventory.io**

</center>

## Inventory.io is a quick and efficient program designed for small retailers to manage their in-store offline inventories. Some of the features planned for this program include, but are not limited to:
	
- **Ability** to create categories for all the products a retailer has to offer; within these categories, retailers can also add additional sub-categories—allowing them to carry products that meet specific needs.
 Example: Let's say a retailer—who is focusing on computer parts—is selling CPUs, RAM modules, SSDs, and GPUs. Using Inventory.io, this retailer can create specific categories of type, CPU, RAM, SSD, or GPU. The retailer can now add all matching products into said categories, allowing them to separate offerings by their purpose; If needed, they can add additional sub-categories that further distinguish the products by their respective brand offerings.

- **Ability** to add descriptors for all of the products offered, making it relatively easy for employees to add/remove/modify/check a product. Default descriptors include pictures of individual products, information about current stock remaining and where in the store to find it, the current price of a product, the color offerings of a product (if applicable), and product number. (*Additional descriptors can be added using the application*)

- **Ability** to create unique product IDs for every product presented by the retailer; this makes it easy to track an item down.

- **Ability** to add/subtract the "x" number of products from stock if the customer refunds/buys it, either by inputting the product ID and "x" number refunded/purchased or allowing a scanner to auto-fill data. (Scanner auto-filling is an idea I want to explore, but not my main focus)

## Why am I interesting in making Inventory.io? 
Having a friend whose parents recently started a local business, I have gotten first-hand experience with the challenges of managing in-store inventory. Now, you may wonder, "how does something seemingly so easy, end up being so onerous?" Well, consider this: As a retailer, if you have no idea what is currently present in your inventory, how are you supposed to know if a product is available for sale? 
Arguably, you could make manual adjustments to your inventory counts; however, a single error could result in the mismanagement of stock information—forcing you to call a manual inventory check-up, which results in wasted time—in a market where time is money. Sure, you could buy a commercialized solution to this otherwise local problem, but that most certainly does not come cheap. This cost may be somewhat justified considering most of these commercial offerings are targeted toward big retailers who own multiple stores.
However, as I mentioned earlier, the business owned by my friend's parents—as of right now—is anything but big; these people only own one store and, as such, only require the management of local/in-store inventory. Considering what I've said, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to go with a cheaper alternative, an althernative such as Inventory.io? Of course it would, and that is my main interest behind creating Inventory.io in the first place, an app made for small retailers to manage their in-store inventory without any headaches and, most importantly, without taking a chunk of their profits.
## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create a category CPU, and within this, add multiple sub-categories for the different brands of CPUs.

Example: (CPU)┐
              ├>(Intel)	
              └>(AMD)

- As a user, I want to be able to add small descriptions for all my products.

- As a user, I want to be able to modify current product information and delete categories or products.

- As a user, I want to be able to save my inventory.

- As a user, I want to be able to reload a saved inventory.

***Side note: If time permits, I want to create the ability to sync inventory data online in the most cost effective way. If a retailer has multiple stores, this online data will allow them to check/sync stock information with every store. Additionally, if the retailer has an online website, this data could also be shared with customers, allowing them to check online if a product is in stock and, if so, where it might be located.***
